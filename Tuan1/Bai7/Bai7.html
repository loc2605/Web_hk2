                        leads the field. Designed for both serious fitness users and beginners, the
                        LSM400's vertical design provides all of the safety and control associated
                        with Smith Machines, while still allowing for the effective use of gravity
                        for effective resistance. You don't even need a workout partner. Lock points
                        can be set to prevent the bar from movement outside of your body's natural
                        range of motion.</td>

                        accessory organizer. Accessories are easy to insert and remove, allowing you to continue your
                        workout without delay. The LSM400 works with all standard Olympic weight plates</td>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Smooth Smith Action:</b> The bar (rated at 800 lb. capacity) slides on Teflon bushings
                    alongside solid steel guide rods. Smooth motion is key to successful workouts,
                    as the target muscles are utilized to their full potential with each repetition.</li>
                <li><b>Proper Angle:</b> The bar travels along a 7 degree path from vertical. Studies have
                    shown that this is the proper lifting angle to increase your comfort and
                    prevent injury.</li>
                <li><b>Safety:</b> The LSM400 has 20 lock-out points for a safe, solid stop at
                    any point in your workout routine.</li>
                <li><b>Rugged:</b> Constructed with heavy 12 gauge steel and 7 gauge reinforcing plate. This is
                    a unit built to last.</li>
                <li><b>Warranty:</b> Every part of the LSM400 has a lifetime guarantee. We will replace
                    or repair anything that goes wrong.</li>
